[**Alba Huidobro**](https://www.albahuidobro.com/) is Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Political Behavior of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Before she was Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford Impact Labs and Department of Political Science, Stanford University. She obtained her Ph.D. from Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona) in July 2022. As a graduate student, she also visited the European University Institute, Nuffield College at the University of Oxford, and the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.

Her research interest lies at the intersections of comparative politics, elites’ political behavior and gender. She examine gender inequalities by analyzing how leaders' attitudes and characteristics shape women’s inclusion in politics and governments. Combining observational and experimental data, her work demonstrates that the dynamics of government negotiations contribute significantly to the gender gap in top political roles, affecting the substantive representation of diverse constituencies.
