  <p>I am strongly committed to a world-class training and supervision of Ph.D. researchers. All my doctoral students go through the “<strong>Dynamics</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Demography,</strong> <strong>Democratic</strong> <strong>Processes</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Public</strong> <strong>Policy</strong>” (<strong>DYNAMICS</strong>) Ph.D. Programme for which I serve as Director. DYNAMICS provides doctoral researchers with a unique and internationally competitive three-year Ph.D. programme in cutting-edge quantitative methods and advanced theories of demography, democracy and public policy. It is a joint endeavour of the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and the Hertie School and funded by the German Research Foundation. From fall 2019, a total of 35 doctoral researchers have studied the relationship between demographic change, democratic processes and public policy.</p>
