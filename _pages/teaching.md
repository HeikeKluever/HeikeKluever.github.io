<p class="post-description"></p>
I am strongly committed to a world-class training and supervision of PhD researchers. All my doctoral Students go through the “**Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy**” (**DYNAMICS**) Ph.D. Programme for which I serve as Director. DYNAMICS provides doctoral researchers with a unique and internationally competitive three-year Ph.D. programme in cutting-edge quantitative methods and advanced theories of demography, democracy and public policy. It is a joint endeavour of the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and the Hertie School and funded by the German Research Foundation. From fall 2019, a total of 35 doctoral researchers have studied the relationship between demographic change, democratic processes and public policy.
