The **Humboldt Governance Lab** (**Humboldt GovLab**) is a research lab at Humboldt University in Berlin that provides research findings to the public using innovative scientific methods.

We develop evidence-based recommendations and conduct evaluations for decision-makers in politics, public administration and civil society to address urgent societal issues.
