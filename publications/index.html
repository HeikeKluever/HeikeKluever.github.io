This book brings together articles from different modules that are part of a larger European Collaborative Research Project, INTEREURO, carried out by research teams in nine different countries under the auspices of the European Science Foundation. The main goal of the book is to analyse strategies, framing and influence processes for a set of 125 legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission, in an effort to better understand the involvement of interest organizations in the decision-making process of the EU. Contributors draw on sophisticated and innovative policy-driven samples of interest group mobilization, allowing them to account systematically for how policy-specific and institutional context factors shape mobilization, lobbying strategies and influence of interest groups on public policy debates in the EU. In this way, the book makes an important contribution to the study of interest groups in the EU and represents the breadth of positions taken in the current literature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/liteu.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="liteu.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_lobbying_2013" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lobbying in the European Union: Interest Groups, Lobbying Coalitions, and Policy Change</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> 2013 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">articles</h2> <h2 class="bibliography">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/jepp32-5.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="jepp32-5.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="milosav_youth_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Youth Gender Gap in Support for the Far Right</div> <div class="author"> Ðorđe Milosav, Zachary Dickson, Sara B.

While progressive parties have traditionally done well among younger voters, it was far-right parties that enjoyed unprecedented electoral support among young voters in the 2024 EP elections. Analyzing data from the European Election Studies (EES) 2024, covering 27 countries and almost 25,000 voters, this paper shows that there is a sizable gender gap in voting for the far right. The electoral success of far-right parties among young voters is primarily driven by the support of young men, peaking at over 21% of all young men in 2024 compared to only about 14% among women of the same age cohort. Descriptive analyses from the EES shows that this gap can partially be explained by attitudinal differences, with young women holding more socially progressive views than young men. Age-Period-Cohort models based on EES data covering eight elections from 1989 to 2024 further reveal that this gender gap is greatest for Millennials and Generation Z. Since political attitudes and voting behaviour during the formative years may have a long-lasting effect on voting patterns and attitudes later in life, our findings have important implications for the future of European democracies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/bjps00-0.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="bjps00-0.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="rodriguez_benchmarking_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Benchmarking Pandemic Response: How the UK’s COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout Impacted Diffuse and Specific Support for the EU</div> <div class="author"> Irene Rodríguez, Toni Rodon, Asli Unan, Lisa Herbig, <em>Heike Klüver</em>, and Theresa Kuhn </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>British Journal of Political Science</em>, Mar 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123424000802" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Does the EU’s performance compared to neighboring countries influence public support? Using a benchmarking approach, we argue that people compare their country’s performance within the EU to that of a non-EU country, shaping their attitudes. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in 2020 provides an ideal test case, as governments launched vaccination programs at different speeds. The UK began weeks before EU countries, allowing us to examine its impact on EU support. Using an Unexpected Event during Surveys Design (UESD) with Eurobarometer data, we find that the UK’s early rollout significantly reduced specific policy support for the EU but did not consistently affect diffuse support.

Even though RRPs tend to end up in opposition, they have considerable influence on policy making within coalition governments. One expectation is that coalition governments are tough on immigration to optimise voter support when being exposed to right-wing parties in parliament. Coalition negotiations temporarily reduce accountability and allow cabinets to adjust policy positions without bearing the costs associated with opportunistic behaviour. This argument is tested using novel data on pre-electoral policy positions and post-electoral immigration policies for coalition cabinets in 24 European democracies from 1980 to 2015. The findings reveal that governments shift to more restrictive immigration policies in face of RRPs. This article expands on prior research on the influence of the radical right by demonstrating its direct influence on coalition governments’ joint immigration policy plans.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/pa32-2.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="pa32-2.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="hartmann_trading_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Trading Liberties: Estimating COVID-19 Policy Preferences from Conjoint Data – CORRIGENDUM</div> <div class="author"> Felix Hartmann, Macartan Humphreys, Ferdinand Geissler, <em>Heike Klüver</em>, and Johannes Giesecke </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Political Analysis</em>, Apr 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2023.29" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cps-online.webp" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cps-online.webp" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_social_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Social Influencers and Election Outcomes</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, Dec 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140241306955" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Do social influencers affect election outcomes? Social influencers can reach millions of people through social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. However, research on social influencers is scarce and it is unclear whether they can affect elections. I argue that social influencers can influence elections through their role as digital opinion leaders and their power to shape the public agenda. Empirically, this study leverages an event that occurred during the 2019 European election campaign. Eight days before the 2019 EP election, the social influencer Rezo published a video in which he severely attacks the christian democratic CDU/CSU which was watched by over 11.5 million users until the election. Based on a differences-in-differences design, it is shown that the video had a sizeable effect on the election resulting in considerable vote losses for the CDU/CSU.

While minority governments have become more common in recent years, the electoral implications for parties supporting such cabinets remain unclear. Previous research suggests that support parties enjoy a favorable position, exerting policy influence while avoiding electoral losses associated with joining the government. However, we argue that this is only true for support parties without written agreements, as their support is less visible to voters. To test our argument, we compiled a novel dataset on the electoral performance of 563 parties in 304 elections across 31 countries since 1980. We estimate the effect of being a support party on subsequent electoral performance. Our findings indicate that parties which declare support perform better electorally than junior partners, while contract support parties do not. These insights shed light on the relationship between minority governments and electoral competition amidst growing party system fragmentation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/psrm00-0.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="psrm00-0.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="unan_europeans_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Europeans’ Attitudes Toward the EU Following Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine</div> <div class="author"> Asli Unan and <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Political Science Research and Methods</em>, Dec 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2024.62" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had profound effects on the stability and security of Europe. This study examines the attitudes of Europeans toward the European Union (EU) in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. Using Special Eurobarometer data collected between February and April 2022 with a representative sample of the EU (N = 26,502), it leverages the quasi-experimental setting with the coincidence between the timing of the invasion and the fieldwork period of the Eurobarometer. Our findings indicate a general increase in support for the EU in the aftermath of the invasion by 4 percentage-points (11 percent of a SD). While the amplitude of the effect remains similar, we see larger treatment effects as more days passed after the invasion. We also observe significant variation at the individual level in treatment effects, particularly by ideology, with left-leaning individuals being more critical of the EU following the invasion. In general, our research demonstrates the significant impact of regional conflicts on public attitudes toward supranational organizations such as the EU and highlights the role of the EU as a provider of security and stability in the face of such conflicts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/nature14-7.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="nature14-7.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="wappenhans_extreme_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Extreme Weather Events Do Not Increase Political Parties’ Environmental Attention</div> <div class="author"> Tim Wappenhans, António Valentim, <em>Heike Klüver</em>, and Lukas F.

Previous research shows that about two thirds of all propositions promised in coalition agreements are actually enacted. But does non-compliance with pledges made in the agreement affect subsequent electoral support? Drawing on the literature on performance voting, we expect that non-compliance is punished by voters, but the effect is conditioned by the importance of the issue and by a parties’ seniority status within the coalition. To test our argument, we have compiled the new comparative COALITIONPOLICY dataset on the enactment of more than 7000 policy pledges by 217 cabinet parties in 19 Western and Eastern European countries from 2000 to 2015. Across a broad range of models, we find no effect of pledge fulfillment on subsequent electoral performance. If anything, adherence to policy-promises only increases support for the prime minister party.

A fourth dataset based on coding of party statutes and party finance data was established together with the Political Party Database. The datasets contain novel indicators on party-group relationships in up to 21 mature democracies. In this research note, we first present the main content of the datasets and the research design.

Given that governments need to secure public support for investments in global vaccine sharing, it is important to understand the levels and drivers of public support for international vaccine solidarity. Using a factorial experiment administered to more than 10,000 online survey respondents in Germany in 2021, we demonstrate that the majority of German citizens are against global inequalities in vaccine distribution. Respondents are supportive of substantive funding amounts, on the order of the most generous contributions provided to date, though still below amounts that are likely needed for a successful global campaign. Public preferences appear largely to be driven by intrinsic concern for the welfare of global populations though are in part explained by material considerations—particularly risks of continued health threats from a failure to vaccinate globally. Strategic considerations are of more limited importance in shaping public opinion; in particular we see no evidence for free riding on contributions by other states. Finally, drawing on an additional survey experiment, we show that there is scope to use information campaigns highlighting international health externalities to augment public support for global campaigns.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/jepp29-7.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="jepp29-7.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="haugsgjerd_allern_policy_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Policy Positions, Power and Interest Group-Party Lobby Routines</div> <div class="author"> Elin Haugsgjerd Allern, <em>Heike Klüver</em>, David Marshall, Simon Otjes, Anne Rasmussen, and Christopher Witko </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of European Public Policy</em>, Jul 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2021.1912148" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/pnas118-36.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="pnas118-36.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_incentives_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Incentives Can Spur COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em>, Felix Hartmann, Macartan Humphreys, Ferdinand Geissler, and Johannes Giesecke </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Aug 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2109543118" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recent evidence suggests that vaccination hesitancy is too high in many countries to sustainably contain COVID-19. Using a factorial survey experiment administered to 20,500 online respondents in Germany, we assess the effectiveness of three strategies to increase vaccine uptake, namely, providing freedoms, financial remuneration, and vaccination at local doctors. Our results suggest that all three strategies can increase vaccination uptake on the order of two to three percentage points (PP) overall and five PP among the undecided. The combined effects could be as high as 13 PP for this group.

We argue that the alignment of organised interests affects opinion–policy congruence by influencing the weight decision‐makers attach to citizen preferences. Moreover, we propose that alignment between majorities of groups and the public matters the most when status quo bias must be overcome for the public to obtain its preferred policy. We test our theoretical claims drawing on a comprehensive media content analysis of 160 policy issues in Germany and Denmark. Our results present a more sceptical picture of the ability of groups to suppress the opinion–policy linkage than the one frequently presented in the academic literature and public debate. We find that the capacity of groups to affect whether policy is congruent with the majority of the public is restricted to situations where the public supports a change in the status quo. In these cases, policy is less likely to end up reflecting public opinion if the majority of interest groups do not support the public position. In cases where the public is supportive of the policy status quo, the position of interest groups does not affect the likelihood that policy will eventually reflect the preferred position of the public.

Based on a newly compiled data set of more than 3,000 voting decisions for 818 legislators on 27 referenda, we find high levels of congruence, but that congruence with the median voter is higher for legislators who are running for reelection.

Based on a novel longitudinal analysis studying the responsiveness of German parties to interest groups across eleven issue areas and seven elections from 1987 until 2009, it is shown that parties adjust their policy agendas in response to interest group mobilization and that interest groups are more successful in shaping party policy when their priorities coincide with those of the electorate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/jepp27-2.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="jepp27-2.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="spoon_responding_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Responding to Far Right Challengers: Does Accommodation Pay Off?</div> <div class="author"> Jae-Jae Spoon and <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of European Public Policy</em>, Feb 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2019.1701530" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/prq72-3.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="prq72-3.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="hopkins_influence_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Influence of Cause and Sectional Group Lobbying on Government Responsiveness</div> <div class="author"> Vincent Hopkins, <em>Heike Klüver</em>, and Mark Pickup </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>, Sep 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1065912918796326" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Voters are increasingly concerned that special interests control the policy process. Yet, the literature on representation is more optimistic: elected officials face strong incentives to listen to voters—not just lobby groups—and this makes for more responsive policies. Building on recent work, we argue a more nuanced point: different types of groups have different effects on responsiveness. We show empirically that lobbying from “cause” groups—representing diffuse interests like climate change—strengthens responsiveness, while lobbying from “sectional” groups—representing industry and professional associations—has no observable effect. Our project uses a novel data set of Canadian lobbying registrations spanning fifteen policy areas from 1990 to 2009. Using a dynamic panel model, we test how interest group lobbying moderates the effect of voter issue attention on government spending. Our findings contribute to contemporary debates over the influence of organized groups, suggesting some interest groups may improve representation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cps52-13.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cps52-13.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_coalition_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Coalition Agreements, Issue Attention, and Cabinet Governance</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> and Hanna Bäck </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, Nov 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414019830726" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Why do coalition parties settle some policy issues in great detail, whereas other issues are hardly mentioned in coalition agreements?

We shed light on why issue attention in coalition agreements varies so extensively. We argue that intra-cabinet conflict positively affects issue attention as parties have stronger incentives to negotiate a detailed policy agenda that constrains their coalition partners. However, we expect that this effect is conditioned by preference tangentiality and the salience of an issue among coalition partners. Our theoretical expectations are tested drawing on a new data set based on a comprehensive content analysis of 224 agreements negotiated by 181 parties between 1945 and 2015 in 24 West and East European countries.

To test these theoretical expectations, data is combined from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the Manifestos Project for nearly 15,000 vote choices of individual voters in 30 elections in 16 West and East European countries from 2001 until 2013.

We use this data set and time series cross-section regression analysis to study the dynamics of coalition parties’ issue attention. Results. We find that junior coalition parties are more responsive to their senior partners than senior partners to their junior partners. Hence, while coalition partners generally follow each other, senior partners enjoy a stronger leadership role in the cabinet. Conclusion. Coalition parties indeed coordinate their issue priorities as they respond to each other’s issue agenda.

In this article, the authors seek to understand the relationship between parties’ participation in coalition governments and their perception by voters. Policy positions are an important instrument through which parties compete for the support of voters. However, it is unclear to what extent voters can correctly perceive the positions of parties when they govern together with other coalition partners. It is argued here that because of the blurred lines of responsibility in multiparty cabinets, it is difficult for voters to correctly perceive the positions of coalition parties. What is more, it is expected that the internal functioning of coalition cabinets affects the extent to which coalition parties struggle to get their message out to voters. It is hypothesized in the article that intra‐cabinet conflict is negatively related to misperception. To test their theoretical expectations, the authors combine data on the left‐right policy positions of political parties from the Comparative Manifestos Project with data on how these positions are perceived by voters gathered from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems from 1996 to 2011.

However, MPs are exposed to a variety of interest groups seeking to influence their voting behavior. We argue that interest groups influence how MPs cast their vote in Parliament, but that this effect varies across groups. While lobbying by sectional groups provides incentives for MPs to defect from their constituents, we expect that cause groups in fact strengthen the link between MPs and their voters. We test our argument based on an innovative study of 118 Swiss public referenda, which allows for directly comparing voter preferences with legislative voting of 448 MPs on these issues. Drawing on a multilevel regression analysis, this study shows that interest groups considerably affect the link between MPs and their voters.

However, due to methodological difficulties, we have remarkably little systematic data about the framing strategies of interest groups. This article therefore proposes a new technique for measuring interest group framing that is based on a quantitative text analysis of interest group position papers and official policy documents. We test this novel methodological approach on the basis of two case studies in the areas of environmental and transport policy in the European Union. We are able to identify the frames employed by all interest groups mobilised in a debate and assess their effectiveness by studying to what extent decision-makers move closer to their policy positions over the course of the policy debate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/gp24-2.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="gp24-2.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_interest_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Interest Groups in the German Bundestag: Exploring the Issue Linkage Between Citizens and Interest Groups</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>German Politics</em>, Apr 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09644008.2015.1024238" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/eup16-3.webp" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="eup16-3.webp" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_promises_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Promises of Quantitative Text Analysis in Interest Group Research: A Reply to Bunea and Ibenskas</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>European Union Politics</em>, Sep 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1465116515581669" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Quantitative text analysis constitutes a promising new method that allows for measuring the policy positions and the lobbying success of interest groups by analyzing their submissions to legislative consultations ( Klüver, 2009 ).

As parties prioritize certain issues over others, we argue that it is both the distance and the salience of the issue for the MEP’s national party that explains defection. To test our theoretical claim, we explore more than 400,000 vote decisions across 1,948 different roll-call votes in four issue areas – agriculture, environment, social policy and external trade – from 1979 until 1999. To measure policy salience and distance, we combine roll-call analysis with data from the Euromanifestos Project.

Previous research has focused on the extent to which parties implement electoral pledges. In this article, we examine how coalition cabinets fulfil post-electoral legislative agendas. Many coalitions announce programmes identifying bills that they plan to introduce to parliament in the months ahead. Even though coalition parties publicly signal commitment to all such proposals, there is variation in the extent to which cabinets meet their own deadlines. We argue that pledge fulfilment is driven by differences in the divisiveness and salience of legislative initiatives. We test our theoretical expectations based on an empirical analysis of over 500 legislative pledges made by the Polish cabinet between 2008 and 2011. Our results confirm that pledges dealing with less divisive and more salient issues are likely to be fulfilled with less delay than those dealing with more divisive and less important issues.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/pp22-3.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="pp22-3.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="back_bicameralism_2014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bicameralism, Intra-Party Bargaining, and the Formation of Party Policy Positions</div> <div class="author"> Hanna Bäck, Marc Debus, and <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Party Politics</em>, Sep 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1354068814549343" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>How do political parties arrive at their policy positions? We conceptualize position formation in federalist countries as an intra-party bargaining process in which subnational parties compete with each other in an attempt to get their own positions into their national party manifesto. Drawing on theories about inter-party bargaining over ministerial portfolios, we hypothesize that the bargaining success of subnational parties depends on their parliamentary strength. We evaluate our hypotheses based on a comprehensive dataset on policy positions of national and subnational parties in Germany from 1990 until 2009. Our results show that German subnational parties that are powerful in the second parliamentary chamber (Bundesrat) are particularly successful in shaping the manifesto of their national party. The findings have important implications for our understanding of intra-party politics and position formation within political parties in Germany more specifically and federalist countries more generally.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/ig&amp;a.webp" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="ig&amp;a.webp" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="borang_identifying_2014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Identifying Frames: A Comparison of Research Methods</div> <div class="author"> Frida Boräng, Rainer Eising, <em>Heike Klüver</em>, Christine Mahoney, Daniel Naurin, Daniel Rasch, and Patrycja Rozbicka </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Interest Groups &amp; Advocacy</em>, Jun 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/iga.2014.12" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/es00-0.gif" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="es00-0.gif" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="spoon_parties_2014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Do Parties Respond?

In order to explain position formation within Europarties, this article argues that national parties compete with each other in an attempt to upload their own policy positions to their Europarty. The article hypothesizes that their ability to succeed in these attempts depends on their legislative resources. The argument is tested by analysing position formation within the four major Europarties for all European Parliament elections between 1979 and 2004. The empirical results confirm that position choice is skewed towards parties with a large seat share, which has important implications for political representation in Europe.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/eup14-3.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="eup14-3.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_ideological_2013" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ideological Congruency and Decision-Making Speed: The Effect of Partisanship Across European Union Institutions</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> and Iñaki Sagarzazu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>European Union Politics</em>, Sep 2013 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1465116512472938" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>How does ideological congruency affect the speed of legislative decision-making in the European Union?

This article suggests that the issue context is an important source of variation because it can facilitate or hamper the ability of interest groups to lobby decision-makers successfully. In order to test the effect of issue characteristics, this article draws on a new, unprecedented data set of interest group lobbying in the European Union. Using quantitative text analysis to analyse Commission consultations, this article studies lobbying success across 2696 interest groups and 56 policy issues. The findings indicate that lobbying success indeed varies with the issue context, depending on the relative size of lobbying coalitions and the salience of policy issues, whereas individual group characteristics do not exhibit any systematic effect.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2010</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/jei.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="jei.jpg" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_europeanization_2010" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Europeanization of Lobbying Activities: When National Interest Groups Spill Over to the European Level</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of European Integration</em>, Mar 2010 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07036330903486037" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2009</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/eup00-0.webp" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="eup00-0.webp" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="kluver_measuring_2009" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Measuring Interest Group Influence Using Quantitative Text Analysis</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heike Klüver</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>European Union Politics</em>, Dec 2009 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1465116509346782" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">url</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The analysis of interest group influence is crucial in order to explain policy outcomes and to assess the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. However, owing to methodological difficulties in operationalizing influence, only few have studied it. This article therefore proposes a new approach to the measurement of influence, drawing on quantitative text analysis. By comparing interest groups’ policy positions with the final policy output, one can draw conclusions about the winners and losers of the decision-making process. In order to examine the applicability of text analysis, a case study is presented comparing hand-coding, WORDSCORES and Wordfish. The results correlate highly and text analysis proves to be a powerful tool to measure interest groups’ policy positions, paving the way for the large-scale analysis of interest group influence.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Heike Klüver.
